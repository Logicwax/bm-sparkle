This is the arduino-based code for my bike at burning man (and my partners).  Lots of sparkles and chasing effects, and color is based off of compass heading (subliminal environment contextual information)


## Materials:
- Arduino mini 20Mhz, 5V
- WS2801 LED strands
- Adafruit BNO055 Absolute Orientation Sensor
- 5V USB Battery pack
- Bike
- Fur if you have some!
